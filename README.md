 ## WARNING
This is an experimental project and is in development, so existing feature syntax might be changed drastically in incremental updates. 
Proper Error handling for syntax has not yet been implemented as of yet. Until it is done fully, if wrong syntax is followed or any function called with wrong or missing parameters, it will not give you expected results and might crash.

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed with beginners in mind, FEAF strives to be accessible to developers of all skill levels. No need to master complex concepts like Redux or Context API.
- **Efficient and Performant**: FEAF is engineered for performance, providing a smooth development experience and optimal runtime efficiency.
